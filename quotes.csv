1," Different verticals need different terminal retention rates for them to have successful businesses. If you  re on e-commerce and you  re retaining on a monthly active basis, like 20 to 30% of your users, you  re going to do very well. If you  re on social media, and the first batch of people signing up to your product are not like, 80% retained, you  re not going to have a massive social media site. [...] What you need to do is have the tools to think,  òwho out there is comparable   and how you can look at it and say,  òam I anywhere close to what real success looks like in this vertical?   ù",Alex Shultz,Analytics
2," Tracking marketing is a cultural thing. Either tracking matters or it doesn  t. You  re in one camp or the other. Either you  re analytical and data-driven, or you go by what you think works. People who go by gut are wrong. ù",Stuart McDonald,Analytics
3," Time and money are your scarcest resources. You want to make sure you  re allocating them in the highest-impact areas. Data reveals impact, and with data, you can bring more science to your decisions. ù",Matt Trifiro,Analytics
4," Have a vision for what you are trying to do. Use data to validate and help you navigate that vision, and map it down into small enough pieces where you can begin to execute in a data-informed way. Don  t let shallow analysis of data that happens to be cheap/easy/fast to collect nudge you off-course in your entrepreneurial pursuits. ù",Andrew Chen,Analytics
5," Execution is so critical. Sometimes you just need to try something, see what works and move forward. ù",Meenal Balar,Analytics
6," When we initially started testing email subject lines, we defined the success criteria as driving an email open. This seemed to be the most straightforward since the Pinner reads the email subject line and the next action is to either open it or don  t. What we found, however, was that defining success with metrics that were further downstream (i.e. clicking on the content in the email) was more effective. ù",John Egan,Analytics
7," If there  s one takeaway it  s that it  s okay to do small wins. Small wins are good, they will compound. If you  re doing it right the end result will be massive. ù",Kevin Li,Analytics
8," The most important thing we've done to improve our user onboarding was to define our activation metric and get serious about tracking the inputs to that metric. Agreeing on what a successfully activated"" account looked like", and understanding all the individual actions to get there,Analytics
9, There  s more objectivity in one customer sharing their passion and love for a product with another than there is in ads or promotion. It allows the company to spend less to achieve lasting growth. ù,Julie Supan,Analytics
10," You can  t run a business today without data. But you also can  t let the numbers drive the car. No matter how big your company is or how far along you are, there  s an art to company-building that won  t fit in any spreadsheet. ù",Chris Savage,Analytics
11," As you gain fresh insight from your data, it opens the door to new questions. As you have new questions, you need to update your instrumentation and analysis. Saying the process is  done ù is saying you understand everything there is to know about your users, product, and channels. ù",Brian Balfour,Analytics
12," Analytics software is uniquely leveraged. Most software can optimize existing processes, but analytics (done right) should generate insights that bring to life whole new initiatives. It should change what you do, not just how you do it. ù",Matin Movassate,Analytics
13," If you pick the right metrics for success, you will be able to significantly improve the focus of the whole team and thus improve your business. Developing these metrics should be done first by making hypotheses about your business and validating / invalidating these hypotheses. From there you will have a good base understanding that will allow you to determine what metrics to focus on and how to define success for your business. ù",Hiten Shah,Analytics
14," The goal is to turn data into information, and information into insight. ù",Carly Fiorina,Analytics
15," You want everyone to be able to look at the data and make sense out of it. It should be a value everyone has at your company, especially people interfacing directly with customers. There shouldn  t be any silos where engineers translate the data before handing it over to sales or customer service. That wastes precious time. ù",Ben Porterfield,Analytics
16," We  ve tried to put passion and art and love and creativity ahead of revenue and valuation and buzz and traction, discovering that the latter can often follow the former. ù",Eoghan McCabe,Analytics
17," Of course hard numbers tell an important story; user stats and sales numbers will always be key metrics. But every day, your users are sharing a huge amount of qualitative data, too  î and a lot of companies either don't know how or forget to act on it. ù",Stewart Butterfield,Analytics
18," We live in a time where data is all around us, and there  s a lot of great advice to show us how to make better use of data. However, I  ve found that in some cases this can be a huge waste of time, especially early on with your startup. Replace some of your current focus on quantitative data to qualitative data). ù",Leo Widrich,Analytics
19," The single most important thing we've done for onboarding is planning past the first session. Let's say you have a SaaS application and know that new users who take actions X, Y, and Z end up being really successful.",Jackson Noel,Analytics
20," The problem with Silicon Valley is when you build an app you are expected to make the app go viral and reach millions of people. This is the worst way to think about it  î it  s much better to get 100 people to love you. There was no way we could get 1M people on Airbnb, but we could get 100 people to love us. This is when we decided to do things that wouldn  t scale. Getting 100 people to love you is hard  î getting people to like you is much easier than getting people to love you. ù",Brian Chesky,Analytics
21," I learned a lesson from watching other companies who held onto things too long. If you look at the history of companies that have succeeded and the ones that have failed, there  s a pretty clear pattern that the ones that have succeeded typically morph every couple of years into something new. And that change is fairly uncomfortable. ù",Kevin Systrom,Analytics
22," [For early-stage startups,] data is never there when you need it most. At best, data can help you make very small, incremental decisions. But if you  re a startup, you  re focused on big, broad swings  î and data has no place in that. You don  t have enough users to draw any meaningful conclusions, and even if you did those users aren  t necessarily representative of your long term target audience. You  ve got data, sure. But not enough to make a genuine, data-driven decision, and pretending otherwise is a recipe for disaster. ù",David Barrett,Analytics
23, Use analytics to make decisions. I always thought you needed a clear answer before you made a decision and the thing that he taught me was [that] you  ve got to use analytics directionally ¶and never worry whether they are 100% sure. Just try to get them to point you in the right direction. ù,Mitch Lowe,Analytics
24, Your metrics influence each other. You need to monitor how. Don  t just measure which clicks generate orders. Back it up and break it down. Follow users from their very first point of contact with you to their behavior on your site and the actual transaction. You have to make the linkage all the way through. ù,Lloyd Tabb,Analytics
25," Merely measuring something has an uncanny tendency to improve it. If you want to make your user numbers go up, put a big piece of paper on your wall and everyday plot the number of users. You'll be delighted when it goes up and disappointed when it goes down. Pretty soon you'll start noticing what makes the number go up, and you'll start to do more of that. Corollary: be careful what you measure. ù",Paul Graham,Analytics
26, Your users are your guidepost. And the way you stay on the right path in the early stages of a startup is to build stuff and talk to users. And nothing else. ù,Jessica Livingston,Analytics
27," For predictive analytics, we need an infrastructure that  s much more responsive to human-scale interactivity: What  s happening today that may influence what happens tomorrow? A lot of iteration needs to occur on a continual basis for the system to get smart, for the machine to  learn ù  î explore the data, visualize it, build a model, ask a question, an answer comes back, bring in other data, and repeat the process. The more real-time and granular we can get, the more responsive, and more competitive, we can be. ù",Peter Levine,Analytics
28, You must constantly try to disrupt yourself. The most successful companies embrace cannibalization at the core. [...]You need to innovate and be willing to threaten the core of your business in order to survive. Or you'll die! ù,Arjun Sethi,Analytics
29," I often see teams that maniacally focus on their metrics around customer acquisition and retention. This usually works well for customer acquisition, but not so well for retention. Why? For many products, metrics often describe the customer acquisition goal in enough detail to provide sufficient management guidance. In contrast, the metrics for customer retention do not provide enough color to be a complete management tool. As a result, many young companies overemphasize retention metrics and do not spend enough time going deep enough on the actual user experience. This generally results in a frantic numbers chase that does not end in a great product. ù",Ben Horowitz,Analytics
30," Don  t obsess over these sub metrics, but obsess over the key metrics that tie into your revenue growth. Everything can be measured, including engineering, PR, product and marketing. If you have your engineering team agree to measure the output of features quarter over quarter, you will get more features built. It  s just a fact. You have to measure every functional area. Measure them all and have everyone agree to the same growth goals to support your revenue, and magical things will happen. ù",Jason Lemkin,Analytics
31," If an Internet company could obsess about only one metric, it should be conversion. No other metric so holistically captures as many critical aspects of a web site  ì user design, usability, performance, convenience, ad effectiveness, net promoter score, customer satisfaction  ì all in a single measurement. Yet despite the remarkable power of this metric, it is alarming how few companies today truly understand conversion and how to optimize it. As such, it is time to pound the table again  ì conversion is by far the most powerful Internet metric of all. ù",Bill Gurley,Analytics
32," You don  t need to learn what customers say they want; you need to learn how customers behave and what they need. In other words, focus on their problem, not their suggested solution. ù",Cindy Alvarez,Analytics
33," Data isn  t useful without the product context. Conversely, having only product context is not very useful without objective metrics... ù",Jonathan Hsu,Analytics
34, Errors using inadequate data are much less than those using no data at all. ù,Charles Babbage,Analytics
35," When you are dealing with a torrent of data, being able to construct different levels of aggregation is really important, because you want to make sure you  ve used your software intelligently with respect to that large amount of data, and bring to bear the contextual data you need to answer the question at the level of aggregation that you need to answer it. ù",Michael O'Connell,Analytics
36," If statistics are boring, you've got the wrong numbers ù",Edward Tufte,Analytics
37, Data are just summaries of thousands of stories  ì tell a few of those stories to help make the data meaningful. ù,Authors of Made to Stick,Analytics
38," [A data-first strategy] is the quest to implement systems (usually massive) to collect data of all shapes and manners before all else. [...]It is being hyper-conservative when it comes to creativity and experimentation because of quant-issues. It is represented by 90% of the data budget invested in Agencies and Consultants driving implementation and re-implementation and hyper-customization of the code. It is represented by the act of creating crazy data thresholds for any initiative to get off the ground. [...]¬† Data is important. I believe it can help drive your business strategy smartly. But, a data-first strategy, defined as above, is nuts. It will only slow down your progress and allow your competitors to crush you like a bug (even if you are a top player in your market today!). ù You can have data without information, but you cannot have information without data. ù",Avinash Kaushik,Analytics
39," A screen full of analytics data looks like a secret code, and in a way it is. That data has a lot of information in it, and it  s impossible to make sense of it without the key. Put another way, data can give answers, but only if you ask the right questions."",Julie Zhuo",Marli Mesibov,Analytics
40," The key is to let computers do what they are good at, which is trawling these massive data sets for something that is mathematically odd, and that makes it easier for humans to do what they are good at  î explain those anomalies. ù",Daniel Gruhl,Analytics
41, Data is a precious thing and will last longer than the systems themselves. ù,Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee,Analytics
42," In a marketing analytics worldview, companies must have an accounting of and insight into all of their marketing programs in all of their channels, including web/browser, mobile apps, TV/video, social, paid media, field, print, outdoor and others. If your organization is still stuck in the web analytics mindset, it is time to reinvent your analytics practice, leveraging all of the available marketing analytics tools to make faster and better decisions and drive your business. ù",Fiona Roddis,Analytics
43," For every $20 you spend on web analytics tools, you should spend $80 on the brains to make sense of the data. ù",Jeff Allen,Analytics
44, As a publicly-traded company you have to do a lot of long-term planning with respect to revenue. You have to become more predictable for investors. And revenue is tied to products that have to ship to meet projections. ù,Jeff Sauer,Analytics
45," Data and A/B test are valuable allies, and they help us understand and grow and optimize, but they  re not a replacement for clear-headed, strong decision-making. Don  t become dependent on their allure. Sometimes, a little instinct goes a long way. ù",Tom Conrad,Analytics
46," The only thing that matters is getting to product/market fit. Product/market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market. You can always feel when product/market fit isn  t happening. The customers aren  t quite getting value out of the product, word of mouth isn  t spreading, usage isn  t growing that fast, press reviews are kind of  blah ù, the sales cycle takes too long, and lots of deals never close. And you can always feel product/market fit when it  s happening. The customers are buying the product just as fast as you can make it î or usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers. ù", Co-Founder at Inspirit,Analytics
47," A big theme that I keep coming back to is, where is the love? It  s basically just finding out which users are passionate about the product. What is the use case on the product that those people have? Why do they actually love the product? And that gives you a good core of information to guide every part of your business. So messaging, you want to reflect that, but also, now that you know that, you want to make sure that you can really get a lot more people to that particular type of use case and that particular type of gratifying experience. So understanding user gratification is really critical in all of it. ù",Monica Rogati,Analytics
48," In my time as a product manager, I was constantly reminding myself to talk to customers more. It might have been to talk about existing features, something under development, or customer pain and processes for product research. It was easy in the beginning, because we knew most of the people using the tool as we worked on the initial version. Even as we got bigger, my feelings usually boiled down to these four words: talk to customers more. I think a critical skill, however, is learning how to talk to the right customers. ù",Mark Andreessen,Analytics
49," The coming era of Artificial Intelligence will not be the era of war, but be the era of deep compassion, non-violence, and love. ",  Amit Ray,Artificial Intelligence
50," Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. The ultimate search engine that would understand everything on the web. It would understand exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing. We re nowhere near doing that now. However, we can get incrementally closer to that, and that is basically what we work on. ",  Larry Page,Artificial Intelligence
51," Cyber hygiene, patching vulnerabilities, security by design, threat hunting, and machine learning-based artificial intelligence are mandatory prerequisites for cyber defense against the next generation threat landscape. ",  James Scott,Artificial Intelligence
52, You have to talk about  The Terminator  if you re talking about artificial intelligence. I actually think that that s way off. I don t think that an artificially intelligent system that has superhuman intelligence will be violent. I do think that it will disrupt our culture. ,  Gray Scott,Artificial Intelligence
53, I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted. ,  Alan Turing,Artificial Intelligence
54," Robots are not going to replace humans, they are going to make their jobs much more humane. Difficult, demeaning, demanding, dangerous, dull   these are the jobs robots will be taking.",  Sabine Hauert,Artificial Intelligence
55, The ultimate search engine would understand everything in the world. It would understand everything that you asked it and give you back the exact right thing instantly. You could ask  what should I ask Larry?  and it would tell you. ,  Larry Page,Artificial Intelligence
56, The key to artificial intelligence has always been the representation. ,  Jeff Hawkins,Artificial Intelligence
57," Some people call this artificial intelligence, but the reality is this technology will enhance us. So instead of artificial intelligence, I think we ll augment our intelligence. ",  Ginni Rometty,Artificial Intelligence
58,"   Without big data, you are blind and deaf and in the middle of a freeway. ", Geoffrey Moore,Big data
59,"  In God we trust, all others bring data. ",W Edwards Deming,Big data

69,"   Where there is data smoke, there is business fire. ",Thomas Redman,Big data
70,  Data is the new science. Big Data holds the answers. ,Pat Gelsinger,Machine Learning
71,"   The pace of progress in artificial intelligence (I m not referring to narrow AI) is incredibly fast. Unless you have direct exposure to groups like Deepmind, you have no idea how fast‚Äîit is growing at a pace close to exponential. The risk of something seriously dangerous happening is in the five-year timeframe.  0 years at most. ",Elon Musk,Machine Learning
72,"   The upheavals [of artificial intelligence] can escalate quickly and become scarier and even cataclysmic. Imagine how a medical robot, originally programmed to rid cancer, could conclude that the best way to obliterate cancer is to exterminate humans who are genetically prone to the disease. ",Nick Bilton,Machine Learning
73,   The key to artificial intelligence has always been the representation. ,Jeff Hawkins,Machine Learning
74,"   It s going to be interesting to see how society deals with artificial intelligence, but it will definitely be cool. ",Colin Angle,Machine Learning
75,"   Anything that could give rise to smarter-than-human intelligence‚Äîin the form of Artificial Intelligence, brain-computer interfaces, or neuroscience-based human intelligence enhancement ‚Äì wins hands down beyond contest as doing the most to change the world. Nothing else is even in the same league. ",Eliezer Yudkowsky,Machine Learning
